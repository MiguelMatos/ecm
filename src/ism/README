A very brief walk through of how to get this running:

Install Pyjamas

Edit Pyjamas Path in client/build.bat

Install libcommon from Pimentech


Create the tables:
    * python manage.py syncdb

Build the javascript:
    * cd client
    * build.bat

Run the server:
    * python manage.py runserver


Test it out:

    * In your browser, goto: http://127.0.0.1:8000/site_media/output/ISM.html
